# Basic Map Usage

In this exercise, you will practice using the `map` function to transform a sequence.

## Task

Write a function called `double-all` that takes a sequence of numbers and returns a new sequence where each number is doubled.

For example:
```clojure
(double-all [1 2 3])
; => (2 4 6)
```
