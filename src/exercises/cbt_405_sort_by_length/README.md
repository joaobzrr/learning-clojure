# Sort by Length

In this exercise, you will use `sort-by` to sort a sequence based on a key function.

## Task

Write a function called `sort-strings-by-length` that takes a sequence of strings and returns them sorted by length (shortest first).

For example:
```clojure
(sort-strings-by-length ["a" "bbb" "cc"])
; => ("a" "cc" "bbb")
```
