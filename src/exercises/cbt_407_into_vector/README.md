# Into Vector

In this exercise, you will use `into` to convert a sequence back into a vector after processing it.

## Task

Write a function called `filter-into-vector` that takes a sequence of numbers and returns a vector containing only the even numbers.

For example:
```clojure
(filter-into-vector [1 2 3 4 5 6])
; => [2 4 6]
```
