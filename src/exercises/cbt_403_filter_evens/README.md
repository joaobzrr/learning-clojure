# Filter Evens

In this exercise, you will use the `filter` function to select specific elements from a sequence.

## Task

Write a function called `filter-evens` that takes a sequence of numbers and returns only the even numbers.

For example:
```clojure
(filter-evens [1 2 3 4 5 6])
; => (2 4 6)
```
